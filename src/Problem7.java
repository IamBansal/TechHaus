    PROBLEM 7:
        In Java, an integer is a signed 32-bit number.
        Therefore, there is a maximum (and a minimum) value that can be stored in a variable of integer type.
        An attempt to assign a numeric value that exceeds this maximum value is known as an overflow condition.
        For example, assume that a Java integer has 8 bits.
        Therefore, the maximum value that can be stored in an 8-bit variable is 127 and the minimum value that can be stored is -128.
        Attempting to store the value 1000 in an 8-bit integer would result in an overflow.
        Write a program that accepts 2 integers and determines if adding and multiplying those 2 integers will result in an overflow.
